# Homework A

### Notes
- All sample times (12:00, 12:15, etc.) is given in AM/PM format. "AM" is assumed when not explicitly present.
- No time conversion is required between client and server.
- When user time falls on the arrival time (12:00AM for Route 1 at Stop 1), it is assumed that next two arrival times are required.
- When calculating wait times, seconds are discarded

### Performance
Currently the route/stop schedule is calculated every time. The results of this calculation can be cached.

### Instructions to run
The easiest way to run the applications is to open the solution file, build it and run "API" and "Console" apps by right-cling each and selecting "Debug" > "Start new instance".
